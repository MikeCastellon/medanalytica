        <strong>What is Psychosomatic Energetics (PSE)?</strong> PSE is a method that addresses repressed emotional traumas — called <em>conflicts</em> — that store life energy and block its normal flow. Using the RebaPad Test Device, four energy levels are tested: <strong>Vital</strong> (physical &amp; regenerative powers), <strong>Emotional</strong> (mood, resilience), <strong>Mental</strong> (concentration, focus), and <strong>Causal</strong> (intuition, inner sensitivity). Conflicts are treated with homeopathic compound remedies (Emvita 1–28), always paired with the corresponding Chakra remedy (Chavita 1–7).
